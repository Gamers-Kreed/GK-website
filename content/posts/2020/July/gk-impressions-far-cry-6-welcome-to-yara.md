### Little History
The Far Cry Series is typically set around a protagonist whom has to explore and survive the mighty wilderness ü¶Åof the local village, city, or town as well as fend off the current despot ü§¥ of the surrounding area. My first rumble with the Far Cry series was Far Cry 3. I really enjoyed it. The Game play and story line kept me entertained for hours a day. I really enjoyed the scenery and the SFX that the game. The little side games kept me interested enough to want to come time and time again.


### Our Gaming Impressionsüïπ

We were only privy to the trailer, but my oh my what a trailer it was. It starts off by showing a protest in the streets of Yara, a fictional Caribbean Island created within the world of Far Cry. The trailer jumps from a burning car, that resembles a sky blue painted [Chevy 1955-1957 Bel-Air][1], to a model car being assembled by a young boy listening to some upbeat music blaring into his ears from his wired AirPods. The boys name is Deigo, voiced by [Anthony Gonzalez][2]. In walks the boys father Anton Castillo, played by [Giancarlo Esposito][3] (G.E.).  After a short father-son moment we find Deigo on the edge of a roof standing next to his father with a grenade in his hands, pin-less and ready to explodeüí•!

### Gameplay: üïπ
From what I have seen there isn't any gameplay shared with the public at this time, but I am fairly sure it will be just as amazing just as amazing as the  previous games in the Far Cry series, if not better. From what I can tell the production budget has been pushed up just a little bit more that than previous installments and I am hoping that the gameplay and captivating story line follow suite.
 

### My Take üëç
When I saw that  [Giancarlo Esposito][3], a.k.a. [Gus Fring][4], a.k.a. [Moff Gideon][5], is set to play the main antagonist for Far Cry 6 I blacked out for a moment only to  wake up and find myself lifting my jaw off of the ground.ü§©  [Giancarlo Esposito][3] as a villainous character has slowly become one of my favorite actors to see psychology ducking it out with a shows protagonist. [Giancarlo Espositos'][3] gravitas, class, and intellect grants him the thespian performances that hearkens me back to the classic banter between [Luke Skywalker and Emperor Palpatine][6] or the feuding between [Baki and his father][7]. [Giancarlo Espositos'][3] on screen villainous delivery is always a welcome pleasure. 


[Giancarlo Esposito's][3] mentioned that he would like to take his thespian skills to the MCU. A talented fan posted up some art... [Professor X][8] this is based upon an [interview][9]. - Nonetheless I am still crossing myü§û. Did someone say Multi-verse?


Let me get off of my soapbox and return FC6. Anton's sos is voiced by [Anthony Gonzalez][2] who happen to also voice Miguel in the movie [Coco][10]. With these two exceptional actors at the helm I believe that Far Cry 6 will be in good hands. It is defiantly a great way to introduce Ubisofts newest addition to the franchise.

### The Wrap Up üéÅ
In closing we really did not see anything new from an interactive point of view, but the production üé• of FC6 seems to be quite the step up when compared to the games predecessors. The Actors that Ubisoft has chosen and the artistry and storytelling that went into the open sequence of the game alone is simply put Brilliant üí°! I can only hope the game play and storyline of the actual game is as polished and well thought out as the production of the trailers that we had the great fortune or partaking this Summer. Far Cry 6 has a release date of the first quarter of 2021.
