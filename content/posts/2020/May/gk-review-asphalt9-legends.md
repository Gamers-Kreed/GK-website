# GK Review - Asphalt 9: Legends

- Asphalt 9: Legends ( Nintendo Switch )

- MSRP: Free (In-App Purchases)

#### Little History
The Asphalt Series started on Nintendo with [Asphalt: Urban GT][5] on Nintendo DS 🕹. For the most part since that initial debate, the Asphalt games have primarily kept it hyped on the mobile frontier📱. Then in the grand ole year of 2019, they finally decided to bring back to the console by way of the Nintendo Switch. This Arcade Racer is a nice call back to one of my favorite racers... [Ridge Racer][6]. The Playstation was coming into it's on and a plethora of Game Studios decided to jump on the bandwagon to help Lift up the Sony Playstation to what it is today and the Ridge Racer games is one of many game that help facilitate that lift off. 


#### Our Gaming Review
Off and on, like a light switch, for the past 3 months I have been "Putting in Dat Work" on Asphalt 9: Legends (A9L). I created a schedule, woke up to 5AM mornings, stayed up to late 11PM-3AM nights, and still was only able to secure a few "[Blueprints][2]" only to maybe get a few of "***my precious***" cars 🏎 up to a 3 star rating.  The reason for the opening breakdown is because in order for you to get anywhere fruitful within this game, you will need to upgrade your cars significantly. You get the Evo Lance to start off and if is a well suited car for the first few races, but that quickly changes as you advance in your "[Career][3]". You will also notice that the currency system is based on [Credits][4] 💰, this is used to purchased upgrades for each of your vehicles.

***Gameplay:*** There is not doubt that this game came from the mobile realm 📱🕹. The constant pop-ups for purchasing add-on for different variety of cars is annoying at best. Sometimes you will think that there is not other way to get upgrades or even beat races unless you purchase an add-on, but to me that just feels like cheating. At least for me they key to getting more Credits is to "Put in Dat Work" inside of the Events, but that is a different story.

Graphics, Sound FX and Tracks are simply put AMAZING for a Nintendo Switch game. A sudden calmness comes over my soul as I play easier tracks. The roar of the engines, the dynamic color ranges of the city scapes and the drivability of the well planned out tracks are just second to none. I really enjoyed the playability of this arcade racer. I can't stress enough on how fun this game really is. It is truly a great substitute for those who miss the Ridge Racer series.

#### Da Wrap up
I you can get past the mobile antics that are thrown at you constantly, then this game is definitely a GREAT buy... FREE! I you are wanting to advance in your career within the game, then you better bring a VERY BIG bucket of patience. It take you a STUPID CRAZY amount of time to get your money/credit right in order to apply any significant upgrades to your garage of different class cars. If you are like me and love playing the game on your mobile devices, but want a little more HD in your gaming escapades, the Asphalt 9 on the Nintendo Switch is just wha the Doctor Ordered.
