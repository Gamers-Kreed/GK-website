### Impressions ( First Look )
Ghost of Tsushima has been on my radar for at least a year now. I kept hearing and reading rumbling about his game, but was very skeptical about it's release, because I could not find any concrete evidence of it's existence, that's until Suck Punch Productions fir a ðŸŽ™+ Drop on May 14, 2020 @4PM ET during a PlayStation [State of Play][2] Presentation. Not to give too much away, but the presentation basically give you a sneak peak at some really Spectacular Gameplay Visuals, Smooth Acoustics, and Legendary Looking Landscapes. The look and feel of the game makes me reminisce to days when I first gazed my eyes upon a MUST watch CLASSIC [Seven Samurai][3].

### Samurai ( Honor the Past) or Ghost (Fight to Live )
From what I gathered the storyline is a battle between fighting with honor while fighting solo or succumbing guerrilla warfare to pick off and unsurmountable amount of enemy forces. With those as my two choices I will definitely be GHOSTING those Fools or go straight SICKO mentality like [Conan][4] - "Crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and hear the lamentation of the women!"

With all I have seen and heard about this game, I do have some high expectations for it. I believe that [SPP][1], has the "Kreed" and experience to pull this off. I can hardly wait to get my hands on this game which at first look seem to the be and instant Classic.

### Notable Call-Outs:
- The option to play the entire game with both English or Japanese VO
- You can change the direction of the Wind ðŸŒ¬. This will make for Amazing Screenshots and Video clips ðŸŽ¥. 
- You can play as a Samurai or a Ghost ðŸ‘»... A.K.A. Stealthy Samurai.
- Last, but certainly not least... YES you can pet the fox ðŸ¦Š.
