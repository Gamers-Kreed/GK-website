# Nintendo Animal Crossing has hit Mainstream... Again?

<!--more-->

Animal Crossing seems to have hit mainstream in 2020, partially because of being quarantined, but mostly because of it having amazing game play. Animal Crossing first dropped April 14, 2001. It was happily accepted by the "easy going" Gaming Community. This year marks the 5 intuition of the Multi-Creature Social Simulation based game. Like Super Mario, Zelda, and  Donkey Kong... Nintendo has added yet another Exclusive Masterpiece to their Nintendo  Collection.




During the first week of game play you  basically start off on a deserted island. Each island bares a particular fruit... in my case it was an üçä, but other random fruits include üçé's, üçê's, and üçí's.  With a bare island that has and variety of butterflies ü¶ã, vegetation and fish, you find yourself in a situation where you need to gather supplies and doing a bit of gardening to upgrade from a tent to an actual house. Tom Nook is a [tanuki][1] that is the over-glorified landlord of the island. This dude and hist minions has all of the money and you and your fellow animal neighbors are they to retrofit the island into a   more modern or classic urban village. The first week you find your self mainly getting to know the land and scrapping literally weeds from the landscape to get any scraps of change and currency that you can.


It‚Äôs hard to pin down when, exactly, the ‚Äúvoid‚Äù term popped up within the fandom, or who coined it. It seems likely that the idea developed on the Bell Tree Forums, one of the oldest and most hardcore Animal Crossing communities. Technically, the mechanic has existed across all Animal Crossing games, though we can see discussion of the void on forums as early as 2013.

With a bit of elbow grease and a lot of productive / non-productive time you finally will be able to scrape up enough of [Tom Nooks'][3] pocket change to purchase a house, that you will have to pay back in [Miles][2],  and also help the little village to obtain a museum, which you will have to go straight "Hunter Gatherer" for to obtain supplies. By the end of week 2 you should have a pretty good idea of how addicting it is to play the amazing game. You will also notice the social aspect of it. You and your friends can start to visit each others islands and you can visit other random islands, not only to see what kind of creativity your friends have, but also gather different types of fruits to bring back to your island and grow. Not to lift the skirt to high on the game, but the game defiantly keeps your attention and your curiosity for the future development of the little community that you hope to build out.



If you're like me and you need some ideas on how to build out your island, there are plenty of people on Twitch who can give you quite the amazing shows and demonstrations on not only hoe to play the game, but also how to manipulate your landscape on your island so the it can truly be your own unique perspective on how a island should look.e villagers. They‚Äôll still remember where they came from.


I must admit that Animal Crossing Horizons was my first leap in the the Animal Crossing series. I was a bit skeptical on how the gameplay would evolve within this Multi-Creature Social Simulation, but I was pleasantly surprised how this game was able to keep my attention for hours at a time. I have no problems recommending this game to my fellow GK  posse.
