[RDR2][1] has done it again. The RDR2 World has cover the 4 B's... Bigger, Better, and Beyond Bodacious! You can spend hours just trying to figure out all of the different species of bird within this [West World Season 1][2] simulator. I was pleasantly surprised, when I popped this game into my XBOX. With all of the different animals, plants, and scenery that you are able to interact with in the game, you can get so immersed in this game. 

Did I mention that there is hunting in this game?!?! This is hunting done right. This is how hunting is supposed to be. Kill or be mauled by your prey.  There is no doubt that RockStorm put in Dat WORK when planning, designing and executing production of this game.

#### â˜† Our Buddies at IGN has a few things you should do first when you grab this SICK game.
